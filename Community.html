Don't worry, amigo, I got you. Here are some of the most random and stupid things that you can do to pass your time. For example: Scrolling on tik-tok... Just kidding, I've got better things for you to do.</p>
<br><br>
<div class="bo"><h2 style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">Fun things to do. Volume 1:</h2>
1. <b>Play an instrument.</b> If you don't know how, this is the perfect time to learn how to pluck out your favorite tune on the piano or guitar.
<br><br>2. <b>Do a deep dive on a subject that interests you.</b> If you find yourself continuously drawn to a specific subject like Impressionism or the animals of Amazon rainforest, set up a queue of documentaries, articles or books on the topic.
<br><br>3. <b>Fill out a crossword puzzle.</b> Go solo, or turn it into a fun family activity if everyone's just laying around.
<br><br>4. <b>Try Origami.</b> Don't get intimidated — there are plenty of online tutorials to give you a hand.
<br><br>5. <b>Play a board game.</b> Turn off the TV and challenge the family to a board game. Introduce the kids to a classic like Chutes and Ladders or Monopoly, or try a newer one like Settlers of Catan that you can all figure out together.
<br><br>6. <b>Put together a puzzle.</b> When you've got lots of time on your hands, get your hands busy. It'll take your mind off boredom, and completing a big puzzle feels great.
<br><br>7. <b>Watch a rom-com marathon. </b>We're not afraid to admit it, romantic comedies have stolen our hearts. Don't forget the popcorn.
<br><br>8. <b>Put together a puzzle.</b> When you've got lots of time on your hands, get your hands busy. It'll take your mind off boredom, and completing a big puzzle feels great.
<br><br>9. <b>Watch a rom-com marathon. </b>We're not afraid to admit it, romantic comedies have stolen our hearts. Don't forget the popcorn.
<br><br>10. <b>Sing along to some Disney songs.</b> Get your endorphins flowing by taking it back to childhood. Belt out your favorite Disney songs!
<br><br>11. <b>Plan your next getaway.</b> Don't just daydream about getting away from it all. Do one better and actually look up plane tickets and hotel rooms.
<br><br>12. <b>Build a fort.</b> Kids know this already: The couch cushions or a few chairs and blankets make an awesome wonderland. Embrace your inner child, or let yours show you the ropes.
<br><br>13. <b>Try new outfits.</b> Even if you haven't gotten new clothes in a minute, creating different outfits can make your wardrobe feel fresh. Mix it up so you'll be ready to wow on your next social outing.
<br><br>14. <b>Write a letter.</b> In the age of text messages and FaceTime, we don't write out our feelings very often. Get out some nice paper and spread some love to a friend or family member.
<br><br>15. <b>Watch a sports game.</b> No sports on live TV? Stream some classic games.
<br><br>16. <b>Call a friend.</b> If you're usually a text communicator, pick up the phone or video call a faraway pal. The real-time connection can make you feel closer.
<br><br>17. <b>Watch a performance.</b> Instead of turning on another reality show, watch an online opera, ballet or symphony.
<br><br>18. <b>Learn a new language.</b> Thanks to apps like Duolingo, you can stretch your mental muscles wherever you are.
<br><br>19. <b>Watch a solo movie.</b> Grab whatever snacks you crave, hoard the couch and laugh or cry as loud as you want: Movies make an excellent date night for one.
<br><br>20. <b>Have a dance party.</b> Turn on some tunes and get those socks hoppin'. Throw it back with oldies from your glory days or find some hot new bops to shake your booty.
<br><br>21. <b>Learn some popular moves.</b> Download the Tik Tok app and challenge yourself to learn the trending choreography all the kids are doing.
<br><br>22. <b>Play a video game.</b> If you don't have a gaming console, try some of the fun games on your phone's app store.
<br><br>23. <b>Write a short story.</b> Or an essay. Or a play — anything that's out of your comfort zone.
