    1. In 10 minutes, a hurricane releases more energy than all the world's nuclear weapons combined. <br>
2. On average, 100 people choke to death on ballpoint pens every year. (This never happened back when we used feather quills on parchment.) <br>
3. On average, people fear spiders more than they do death. (Especially that big hairy thing behind my dryer that pops out when I change loads. Yikes!) <br>
4. Thirty-five percent of the people who use personal ads or online apps for dating are already married. And, men are three times more likely to use them than women. <br>
5. Only one person in two billion will live to be 116 or older. <br>
6. It's possible to lead a cow upstairs…but not downstairs. (Which explains why the phrase "You can lead a cow upstairs …." never caught on like leading a horse to water.) <br>
7. Women blink nearly twice as much as men. (Research has shown that dumbfounded wives blink at five times their husbands' rate after he has done something idiotic.) <br>
8. The Main Library at Indiana University sinks over an inch every year because engineers failed to account for the weight of all the books that it would eventually hold. (In other news, there's probably no truth to the rumor that you can enroll in the IU School of Engineering for $1.99 per credit hour.) <br>
9. A crocodile cannot stick its tongue out. (This is only a problem for pre-teen crocs when their parents ask them to do chores.) <br>
10. Ping Pong balls can travel off the paddle at speeds up to 160 km/hr. That's just under 100 mph. <br>
11. A dentist invented the electric chair. (I think he didn't have many repeat patients.) <br>
12. In ancient Egypt, priests plucked EVERY hair from their bodies, including their eyebrows and eyelashes. (Any modern woman that has attempted to pluck a man's eyebrows only to hear him scream like a toddler finds this fact unbelievable.) <br>
13. TYPEWRITER is the longest word you can type using only the letters on one row of the keyboard. (And no … QWERTYUIOP is not a word!) <br>
14. "Go." is the shortest complete sentence in the English language. (However, scientists found that virtually every woman on the planet just has to give her significant other "The Look," and they don't even have to use the word, "go." It's pretty much understood.) <br>
15. Nutmeg is extremely poisonous if injected intravenously. (Be careful next time you visit Grandma during the holidays. I'm just sayin'….) <br>
16. Honey is the only natural food made without destroying any life. What about milk, you say? A cow has to eat grass to produce milk, and the grass is living. There you go … <br>
17. A snail can sleep for three years. <br>
18. No word in the English language rhymes with "MONTH." <br>
19. Cephalacaudal recapitulation is the reason our extremities develop faster than the rest of us. (I'm not sure what this is, but I'm ready to kick your butt in our next game of Scrabble®, Grandma!  Hey … is that nutmeg I smell?) <br>
20. The most common name in the world is Mohammed. <br>
21. The cigarette lighter was invented before the match. <br></figcaption></figure>

      1. The first cinemas were opened in the early 1900s. Before then, films were shown in public halls, theatres or at funfairs! <br>

2. Movies used to be recorded on film and were then shown to audiences by being run through a projector on reels. Nowadays, the process is all digital, with smaller cameras and digital projectors in cinemas. <br>

3. Films were originally made without sound. Known now as ‘silent movies,’ when they were shown there was often a live piano player, organist or small group of musicians present to add atmosphere. <br>

4. When films began to be made with sound, they were known as ‘talkies.’ The first film to be made with sound is called ‘The Jazz Singer’ and it was made in 1927. <br>

5. Films were originally made in black and white. Although many filmmakers experimented with colour, the first successful use of it was in the very famous 1939 film ‘The Wizard of Oz.’ The film starts in black and white and then changes into stunning technicolour when Dorothy arrives in Oz. <br>

6. During the 1930s and 1940s, films became incredibly popular. In America, they became the most popular form of entertainment during this time, which became known as the ‘golden age of cinema.’ <br>

7. In the 1950s, more and more people were buying a television for their home. This meant there were less people going to the cinema. Filmmakers tried to encourage people back to cinemas by making films that were even more spectacular and epic. <br>

8. The 1950s also saw the rise of 3D films. These became popular again in the 2000s with the release of the science-fiction film ‘Avatar.’ You can now watch films in 4D! Watching a 4D film in a cinema might include you experiencing things like your chair shaking, feeling hot and cold, and you being able to smell certain scents! <br>

9. The most successful film of all time is thought to be ‘Gone with the Wind.’ Made in 1939, the film has made an estimated £2.5 billion! <br>

10. The most expensive film ever made is thought to be ‘Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.’ It cost around £268 million! <br>

11. Heath Ledger’s lip-licking as the Joker was to keep his prosthetics on. <br>

12. Cary Elwes was knocked out while filming The Princess Bride. <br>

13. The bees in Candyman’s famous scene are real. <br>

14. Some of the dinosaur noises in Jurassic Park were the sounds of tortoises mating. <br>

15. The crew of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly accidentally blew up a bridge. <br>

16.  In Titanic, Jack accidentally telling Rose to lie on the “bed” instead of the “couch” before he draws apparently wasn’t in the script. <br>

17. M'Baku's grunting in Black Panther was apparently "totally improvised" by Winston Duke. <br>

18.  Janet Leigh, who played Norman Bates's first onscreen victim Marion Crane in Psycho, has said that after seeing the infamous scene, she avoided showers whenever possible. <br>

19. In The Sixth Sense, producer Frank Marshall originally didn't want the camera to zoom in on Malcolm's face after Cole says "I see dead people," because he thought it'd be a (dead) giveaway that Malcolm was actually one of said dead people. <br>

20.  You might think there's not much room for improv in an animated film, but in The Lion King, Nathan Lane reportedly ad-libbed Timon saying, "What do you want me to do, dress in drag and do the hula?" It ultimately led to the addition of the song-and-dance routine. <br>

21. The Matrix code comes from sushi recipes. <br></figcaption></figure>

  1. Present-day Athens is Named after the Greek Goddess Athena. <br>
  2. Aphrodisiacs are Related to the Greek Goddess Aphrodite. <br>
  3. Heracles had a twin brother (not fathered by Zeus). He also had a younger sister (also not Zeus's daughter). Heracles had many male lovers. <br>
  4. Heracles's birth name was actually Alcides or Alcaeus, but his mother renamed him to try and appease Hera (it didn't work). <br>
  5. Unlike so many other Heroes, Perseus was one of the few without flaws or a tragic ending. <br>
  6. Hades and Persephone aren't even the main characters in their most famous story; Demeter is. (In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter). <br>
  7. Sparta, who everyone says that they loved Ares, didn't even have a temple to him . Their patron gods were Apollo and Artemis . <br>
  8. The reason the Minotaur has that name is because its origins can be traced back to King Minos being punished by Poseidon for trying to fool the god. <br>
  9. Also, Pandora's Box isn't actually a box. In the original myth, it's described as a Jar. Nowadays most people see it as a box because of a translation error done long ago on the story. <br>
  10. Poseidon created the first Horse and so became the god of horses. He's also the god of earthquakes. <br>
  11. Out of all the male Olympians, Ares is the only one who doesn't have a story with him being a sex offender. <br>
  12. Units of time and elements of the Norse cosmology are personified as gods or beings. <br>
  13. In Norse myth, Odin is the equivalent of Zeus in Greek mythology; he is the father of all the gods. Odin has only one eye because he traded his other eye for a drink from the well of wisdom and gained immense knowledge. <br>
  14. Arguably one of the most successful TV shows of our time, Game of Thrones, has clear references to Norse mythology, and its producers have openly admitted that North European folklore has been a central source of their inspiration behind the show. <br>
  15. The Vikings is another popular historical drama television series whose plot is heavily based on Norse myth and folklore. The characters often have visions of Odin and pray to several Norse gods, such as Thor and Freyr, among others. <br>
  16. A popular video game titled Too Human has a story line based on Norse myth that interprets the gods as cybernetically enhanced humans. <br>
  17. Frigg is by far the most famous Norse goddess and is also Odin’s wife. She represents marriage and motherhood. It is also believed that she supposedly knows every person’s destiny but has never revealed it to anyone. <br>
  18. Odin’s grandfather sprang from salt stones constantly licked by a cow. Hmm, not exactly the way one would picture the birth of a god, right? <br>
  19. Norse mythology influenced Richard Wagner’s use of literary themes in his composition of the four operas that make up The Ring of the Nibelung. <br>
  20. Tuesday is named after the Norse god of war and justice, Tyr. In French, Spanish, and Italian, Tuesday is named after Mars, the Greco-Roman god of war. <br>
  21. According to Norse mythology, the first human couple was Ask and Embla, not Adam and Eve. <br></figcaption></figure>
