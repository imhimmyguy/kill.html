<h1 style="margin-left: 25%;">Random presents to you...</h1>
<h1 style="margin-left: 35%;"> Random songs you should be listening to.</h1><br><br>
<img src="music.jpg" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;" width="80%">
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">Welocome to Random's list of Random songs you should be listening to. Now, this isn't a list of the greatest songs ever made, nor of the most pleasing songs to listen to. This is simply an extremely biased list of the most fun, funny and also my favorite songs that you should be listening to instead of wasting your time on this stupid website. Without any further delay, ladies, gents or whatever you are, let us begin our legendary list.</p>
<br>
<h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">1. Ok cha ta.</h2>
<iframe width="80%" height="500px" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iz29gy_ktNc?si=w3zprqf-IUHUwy70" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">2016 Nepali song "Ok xa ta" is not an undeniable classic, the most popular song of it's era, nor is it the most thought-provoking or complex song of all time. That is fine though, as it wasn't meant to be any of that. It excels however, at the one thing that it attepts to do. It is an extremely fun song to listen to. And to be real, who doesn't love that? You don't? Well, doesn't matter because I do. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">Now, if that isn't your type of song, you are free to scroll, however, if it is, I can promise you that it will be one of your favorite songs of all time, just as it is mine. And if it isn't, the least I can promise you is that it will make you laugh, like, really hard.</p>
<br>
<h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">2. Jingle bells (Bhojpuri eddition)</h2>
<iframe width="80%" height="500px" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u1UY1GtYaOI?si=RnCV3SDUrWI59vJa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">Now, continuing with the extremely funny songs that will put a smile on your face, we also got the Bhojpuri edition of the popular christmas song 'Jingle bells'. Released in 2018, this song has still not gotten old for me and I still laugh listening to it, even though I know exactly what will happen next.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">Again, I'm not sure if this will be one of your favorite songs of all time, but man, you'll be in a very small minority if you dislike it.</p>
<h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">3. Sing about me, I'm dying of thirst</h2>
<iframe width="80%" height="500px" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/75wmW7xjyog?si=e_FQomraULKXVaWI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">This is the first song on the list that would genuinely be up for debate for one of the best songs of all time. Off Kendrick Lamar's 2nd studio album, Good kid M.A.A.D city, it an extremely critically acclaimed song heavily celebrated as Lamar's very best. Unlike the previous 2, this is one of the most complex and thought-provoking songs of all time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">The song is divided into 2 parts, Sing about me and I'm dying of thirst, the first part in itself consisting of 3 verses. It isn't a song you'll laugh at, nor a song to play in the background while doing your work. It is an emotional, thought-provoking song that will make you actually think. And fellas, if I die before this webpage drops... Promise that you will sing about me.  </p>
<h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">4. The real slim shady</h2>
<iframe width="80%" height="500px" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJO5HU_7_1w?si=gckAAyqiztxcuEUx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">Social norms are not really something to bother slim shady, as seen by his 2000 hit song, 'The real slim shady'. Now, those familiar with Eminem might be wondering why I used this particular Eminem song and not a complex storytelling masterpiece like stan or his even more controversial Without me.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">While this may not be a Stan or a Without me, it is a song that combines comedy with complex lyrical wordplay and controversy. It was the song that opened the doors for many new rappers to just say whatever was on their mind instead of going side by side with the standard norms of society. Not only that, it is also one of his best and most polarizing works of all time. So, with that said.... Will the real slim shady please stand up?</p>
<h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">5. All caps</h2>
<iframe width="80%" height="500px" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gSJeHDlhYls?si=UM9XIkFqN95Mb_xB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">MF DOOM really was one of the gratest when it came to his wordplay and impact, as seen by his hit song off of his infamous Madvillainy album, All caps. At the time I'm writing this, it's been 20 years since this track was released and a person still can't be safe from backlash if they dare to spell DOOM's name in small letters.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">The internal rhyme schemes that made DOOm such a beloved emcee is heavily present in this monster of a track. Originally not a well recieved song among the massses, this song has now become one of the supervillain's most popular songs, and an cold classic among his fans. Speaking of his fans, Make sure you don't incure their wrath by spelling the man's name as anything other than all caps.</p>
<h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">6. Silver</h2>
<iframe width="80%" height="500px" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QECJ9pCyhns?si=8tSJx5p6ri1vZks0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">Never in my life did I believe I would be calling a Nirvana song underrated but here we are. This is not Nirvana's best record just to be clear, but since this is a songs you should be listening to and not songs you have listened to. So, no better song for this list than Silver. Sorry, man, but you can't be calling yourself a nirvana fan if you haven't listened to this song.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">This song is amazing, to say it in simple terms. To go a bit deeper, it is a musical masterpiece that can't get old no matter how many times you have heard it. All members have put out one of their best musical performances in this song, especially Kurt Cobain, with his powerful voice, that will make you feel like a god.</p>
<h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">7. Purple rain</h2>
<iframe width="80%" height="500px" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TvnYmWpD_T8?si=fHmMI9U64tH77DGr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">If you haven't heard this tragedic masterpiece, respectfully, what the hell have you been doing your entire life? I have heard this song about hundreds of time in my life, and I can confidently say, this song is a masterpiece. A song that will make you cry while you are still appreaciating this masterpiece for what it is.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">I'm serious. This song was the one that made me fall in love with Prince's music, and that was how I met one of my favorite artists of all time. So, if you missed this song by any chance, go do yourself a favor and listen to this 3 times for the years you didn't listen to it.</p>
<h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">8. Runaway</h2>
<iframe width="80%" height="500px" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EMnQwBTJnMM?si=mu9iIci5ksDWwE40" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">Ah, yes, this song is nothing special, just the best produced song of all time. Off of Kanye West's 2010 classic album, My beautiful dark twisted fantasy, featuring artist Pusha T, Runaway really has it all. An elite rap verse, along with meaningful lyrics delivered perfectly by Ye over a hauntingly beautiful beat that truly one of the best crafted of all time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">9 minutes might initially seem like an extremely long time, however once you listen to it, you will feel that it's too short for such a beautiful masterpiece. You know from the first piano key played on this song that this is an elite song. If you haven't listened to it for some dumb reason like 'Ah, I'm a T. Swift fan.' or 'Ye's too controversial', Shut the fuck up and listen to this masterpiece. I'm ready to bear all responsibity if you don't like it.</p>
<h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">9. In the end </h2>
<iframe width="80%" height="500px" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eVTXPUF4Oz4?si=noke8E3q5uU_nM7t" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">Ah, yes. Linkin Park. Really, I shouldn't even need to tell you about this song. The only reason it is in a Songs you should listen to list is because you should go listen to it again. All these years later, anmd this song still makes me feel unstoppable. This is probably my favorite Linkin park, solely off the impeccable vocal performance on this legendary song.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">Man, I'm telling you. If you have heard this song, go listen to it again. And if you haven't, Sorry, but you and I can't be friends.</p>
<h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">10. Not like us.</h2>
<iframe width="80%" height="500px" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H58vbez_m4E?si=2VCm5aU383BSP7G7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">Yes, yes. I'm a KDOT glazer and yes, this is the 2nd Kendrick Lamar song on this list. But, this thing absolutely deserves it. Like, have you ever heard of a catchier way of calling someone a bloody pedophile? I haven't. All jokes aside, this is of of the most popular soings right now for a bloody reason. This shit is fucking good. Additionally, I feel like at this point in time, this is the song that represents rap beef as a whole. And considering how important rap beef is to the culture, this is one of the most influential of all time.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">This song was the definition of Kenny popping off, hopping out and making it look sexy. It's a great diss track, a lyrically complex song and a club banger. What more do you want from a song.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">Well, this is it for the list people. Hope you enjoyed it. Also, since you made it to the end, let me give you all a bonus. These are some of the best alarm sounds and ringtones of all time.</p>
<h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: x-large;">Ringtones</h2>
